### Next Steps:

1. **Database Setup** (if not done already):
   - Go to your [Supabase SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uvffkjlrdhqjyqeuyufq/sql/new)
   - Copy and run the contents of `scripts/comprehensive-setup.sql`

2. **Test Your Application**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:3000

3. **Create Test Users**:
   - Sign up for a new account at `/auth`
   - Check the dashboard at `/dashboard`
   - Admin features at `/admin` (after promoting user to admin)

### Key Features Working:
- ✅ User authentication (sign up/sign in)
- ✅ Role-based access (user/admin)
- ✅ Package tracking system
- ✅ Admin dashboard
- ✅ User profile management
- ✅ Secure API endpoints

### Security Notes:
- 🔒 Service role key is server-only (never exposed to client)
- 🔒 Row Level Security enabled on all tables
- 🔒 Proper role-based permissions implemented
